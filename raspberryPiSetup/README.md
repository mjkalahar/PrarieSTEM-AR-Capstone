# raspberryPiSetup

This is home to all things related to setting up a new raspberryPi
<br>
The first thing we have so far is to set up the operating system with the standard Raspbian distro. Next I connected the PI to the tv and enabled ssh, camera, I2C.
<br>
Next I downloaded the script using WinSCP but can also pull from repository. Use `chmod +x setup.sh` to make it executable and run with `./setup.sh`
